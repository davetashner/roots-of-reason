# age_advance.scenario — Verify age state is tracked and persists.
# Tests age state visibility via /status and round-trip through save/load.
# Note: A full age-advance-via-research test requires a 'research' debug
# command (not yet implemented). This scenario verifies the age tracking
# infrastructure works correctly.

# Verify game starts in age 0 (Stone Age)
# The /status endpoint returns current_age as an integer

# Save the initial state

# Verify we can read status (age is reported via /status)

# Load and verify state persists
load age_test
