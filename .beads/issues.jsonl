{"id":"roots-of-reason-3hk","title":"ADR-008: Art Pipeline — Isometric Asset Production Strategy","description":"Defines the visual production pipeline for all game assets: tiles, units, buildings, UI elements, effects. This is the single highest-risk bottleneck for a solo/small team building an isometric RTS. Every decision here has compounding downstream effects — tile dimensions determine map scale, sprite resolution determines animation cost, and art method determines total throughput.\n\nDECISION\n\n1. Tile geometry: 128x64px diamond tiles (2:1 ratio). Elevation step: 32px vertical offset per level (half tile height). This gives 3 usable elevation levels within reasonable sprite heights.\n\n2. Sprite scale contract:\n   - Villager: ~48px tall (standing), fits within one tile footprint\n   - Infantry/military: ~52-56px tall\n   - Cavalry/mounted: ~64px tall\n   - Buildings (1x1): 128x128px max (one tile footprint, extends above tile)\n   - Buildings (2x2): 256x192px max (four tile footprint)\n   - Buildings (3x3): 384x256px max (Town Center, Wonder)\n   - Trees/resources: ~64-80px tall, single tile footprint\n\n3. Animation budget per unit type:\n   - Idle: 4 frames x 8 directions = 32 frames\n   - Walk: 8 frames x 8 directions = 64 frames\n   - Attack: 6 frames x 8 directions = 48 frames\n   - Death: 6 frames x 1 direction (mirrored) = 6 frames\n   - Gather (villager only, per resource type): 6 frames x 4 directions = 24 frames x 4 = 96 frames\n   - Total per military unit: ~150 frames\n   - Total for villager: ~230 frames (most expensive unit)\n   Buildings: idle (1-2 frames), construction (4 stages), destruction (3 stages), no directional variants.\n\n4. Art production method: Hybrid pipeline.\n   - Phase 1 (prototype): Colored geometric shapes. Diamonds for tiles, circles for units, rectangles for buildings. Distinct colors per type. Zero art skill required. Gets the game playable immediately.\n   - Phase 2 (alpha): AI-generated base sprites (Stable Diffusion / DALL-E / Midjourney) with manual cleanup in Aseprite. Generate isometric renders, hand-clean edges, ensure palette consistency. Fastest path to \"looks like a game.\"\n   - Phase 3 (polish): Hand-pixel or commission professional sprites for hero units, unique buildings, and UI. Replace AI bases where quality falls short.\n   This phased approach means art never blocks engineering. Gameplay is always testable with current-phase art.\n\n5. Color palette: 5 palettes — one per age cluster.\n   - Stone/Bronze Age: earthy browns, muted greens, terracotta\n   - Iron/Medieval Age: deeper greens, grays, stone blues, banners with civ colors\n   - Industrial Age: brick reds, iron grays, smoke, amber\n   - Information/Singularity Age: steel blues, white, neon accents, holographic highlights\n   Each civ has a primary + secondary color applied to units and building banners (not full recoloring — just team markers).\n\n6. Tileset scope (minimum viable for map gen):\n   - 5 base terrain types: grass, forest floor, desert/sand, shallow water, deep water\n   - Per terrain: center tile + 8 edge transitions to each adjacent type = massive combinatorial explosion\n   - Solution: Use Godot 4 TileMap terrain autotiling. Define terrain peering bits. Need ~15-20 tile variants per terrain type to cover edges, corners, and inner corners.\n   - Total base tileset: ~80-100 tile variants for 5 terrains\n   - Mountain/cliff tiles: separate layer, ~20 variants\n   - Elevation transitions: ~12 variants (ramp up, ramp down, cliff edge per cardinal direction)\n   - Grand total tileset: ~120 tiles minimum viable\n\n7. Asset file organization:\n   - assets/sprites/units/{civ}/{unit_name}/ — spritesheet per unit\n   - assets/sprites/buildings/{civ}/{building_name}/ — spritesheet per building\n   - assets/tiles/terrain/ — tileset textures\n   - assets/tiles/elevation/ — elevation tiles\n   - assets/ui/ — UI elements, icons, fonts\n   - assets/effects/ — particle textures, projectiles\n   - assets/audio/ — sound effects, music (future)\n   Naming convention: snake_case, descriptive. E.g., villager_walk_se_03.png\n\n8. Spritesheet format: Pack all directional frames into a single spritesheet per animation. Use Godot SpriteFrames resource for animation definitions. Aseprite as the source-of-truth editor (exports to PNG spritesheet + JSON metadata).\n\nCONSEQUENCES\n\n- Phased art approach means engineering is never blocked by art production\n- Geometric placeholders are ugly but functional — game is always playable\n- AI-assisted middle phase dramatically accelerates asset production (10x vs hand-drawing)\n- 128x64 tile size is generous enough for detail but small enough to fit large maps on screen\n- Animation budget is realistic (~150 frames/unit) — not cutting corners but not AAA\n- The tileset scope (~120 tiles) is the first major art investment and should be prioritized\n- Sprite scale contract prevents the \"everything is the wrong size\" problem that kills isometric games\n- 8-direction sprites are industry standard for isometric; 4 directions looks cheap, 16 is overkill","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"decision","owner":"dave@mainstreetlogic.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T20:04:37Z","created_by":"Dave Tashner","updated_at":"2026-02-22T20:04:37Z","labels":["adr","architecture","art"]}
