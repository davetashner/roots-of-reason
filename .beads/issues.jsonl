{"id":"roots-of-reason-3hk","title":"ADR-008: Art Pipeline — Isometric Asset Production Strategy","description":"Defines the visual production pipeline for all game assets: tiles, units, buildings, UI elements, effects. This is the single highest-risk bottleneck for a solo/small team building an isometric RTS.\n\nDECISION\n\n1. Tile geometry: 128x64px diamond tiles (2:1 ratio). Elevation step: 32px vertical offset per level (half tile height). 3 usable elevation levels.\n\n2. Sprite scale contract:\n   - Villager: ~48px tall (standing), fits within one tile footprint\n   - Infantry/military: ~52-56px tall\n   - Cavalry/mounted: ~64px tall\n   - Buildings (1x1): 128x128px max\n   - Buildings (2x2): 256x192px max\n   - Buildings (3x3): 384x256px max\n   - Trees/resources: ~64-80px tall, single tile footprint\n\n3. Animation budget per unit type (AUTHORING cost, not output count):\n   - Idle: 4 keyframes (rendered to 32 output frames via 8 cameras)\n   - Walk: 8 keyframes (rendered to 64 output frames)\n   - Attack: 6 keyframes (rendered to 48 output frames)\n   - Death: 6 keyframes (rendered to 6 output frames, 1 direction mirrored)\n   - Gather (villager, per resource): 6 keyframes x 4 types (rendered to 96 output frames each)\n   - Military unit authoring cost: ~24 keyframes -\u003e ~150 output frames (6x multiplication via render rig)\n   - Villager authoring cost: ~48 keyframes -\u003e ~230 output frames\n   The 3D render pipeline eliminates per-direction manual work entirely.\n\n4. Art production method: THREE-PHASE AUTOMATED PIPELINE.\n\n   Phase 1 (prototype) — FULLY PROCEDURAL, ZERO MANUAL ART:\n   A Python/GDScript generator creates all placeholder sprites programmatically.\n   Colored geometric shapes: diamonds for tiles, circles for units, rectangles for buildings.\n   Script generates all directions, animation frames, player color variants.\n   Output committed to repo OR generated at build time.\n   Game is playable within hours of project creation.\n\n   Phase 2 (alpha) — BLENDER 3D-TO-2D RENDER PIPELINE:\n   This is the core production method, modeled after how Age of Empires was actually made.\n   (a) Model unit/building once in Blender (low-poly, stylized)\n   (b) Rig with standard humanoid skeleton (units) or no rig (buildings)\n   (c) Animate once — walk cycle, attack, idle, death. ONE direction only.\n   (d) Isometric render rig: 8 cameras at 45-degree intervals, all at iso angle (30 deg from horizontal), orthographic projection, consistent lighting\n   (e) Blender script batch-renders all animations from all 8 cameras automatically\n   (f) Pipeline script packs rendered PNGs into spritesheets, generates Godot SpriteFrames resources\n   (g) Player color variants: render with neutral base, apply team color via shader at runtime (NOT re-rendering per player)\n   One animation authored = 8 directions output. One model = all player colors via shader.\n\n   Phase 3 (polish) — TEXTURE REFINEMENT:\n   AI-generated textures applied to 3D models, re-rendered through same pipeline.\n   Hand-touch-up on final spritesheets in Aseprite for hero units and unique buildings.\n   Pipeline stays the same — only the model/texture quality improves.\n\n5. Player color system: Runtime shader recoloring, NOT baked sprites.\n   Units and buildings rendered with a designated \"team color\" mask region.\n   A Godot shader swaps the mask color to the player's color at runtime.\n   This means ONE set of sprites serves all players — no per-player sprite variants needed.\n   Player colors: Blue (#2E86DE), Red (#E74C3C), Teal (#1ABC9C), Orange (#F39C12).\n\n6. Color palettes per age cluster:\n   - Stone/Bronze: earthy browns, muted greens, terracotta\n   - Iron/Medieval: deeper greens, grays, stone blues\n   - Industrial: brick reds, iron grays, smoke, amber\n   - Information/Singularity: steel blues, white, neon accents, holographic\n\n7. Tileset production:\n   - 5 base terrains, ~15-20 variants each via Godot TileMap terrain autotiling\n   - Terrain tiles: procedurally generated for Phase 1, Blender-rendered for Phase 2\n   - Total: ~120 tiles minimum viable (80-100 terrain + 20 mountain + 12 elevation)\n\n8. Asset file organization:\n   - assets/sprites/units/{unit_name}/ — spritesheet per unit (shared across players via shader)\n   - assets/sprites/buildings/{building_name}/ — spritesheet per building\n   - assets/tiles/terrain/ — tileset textures\n   - assets/ui/ — UI elements, icons, fonts\n   - assets/effects/ — particle textures, projectiles\n   - blender/ — source .blend files, render rig template, batch export scripts\n   - tools/ — procedural generator, spritesheet packer, CI validation scripts\n\n9. Automation toolchain (all scripted, all CI-validated):\n   - tools/generate_placeholders.py — generates Phase 1 geometric sprites\n   - tools/spritesheet_packer.py — packs rendered PNGs into spritesheets + Godot resources\n   - blender/render_rig.blend — template scene with 8 cameras, lighting, render settings\n   - blender/batch_render.py — Blender script: render all animations for a model from all cameras\n   - CI step: validate sprite dimensions match scale contract, frame counts match budget\n\nCONSEQUENCES\n\n- Phase 1 is FULLY AUTOMATED — zero manual art, game playable immediately\n- Phase 2 authoring cost: ~24 keyframes per military unit (not 150 hand-drawn frames)\n- 3D pipeline gives 6-8x frame multiplication — 8 directions for the cost of 1\n- Player colors handled by shader — no per-player sprite duplication\n- Same pipeline serves all 3 phases — only input quality improves\n- Blender is free, scriptable, and has excellent isometric rendering support\n- CI validates sprite consistency — wrong dimensions caught before merge\n- Total authoring cost for 6 unit types: ~200 keyframes (not 1050 hand-drawn frames)","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"decision","owner":"dave@mainstreetlogic.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T20:04:37Z","created_by":"Dave Tashner","updated_at":"2026-02-22T20:18:05Z","labels":["adr","architecture","art"]}

Use smooth interpolation between original and team color based on proximity to mask color.\n- Shading preservation: a dark magenta pixel should become a dark version of the team color, not flat team color.
