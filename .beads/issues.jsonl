The CI pipeline is a first-class game system that enforces quality gates on every PR.\n\nDecisions: (1) GdUnit4 as the unit/integration test framework (GDScript-native, JUnit XML output, CI-friendly). (2) Minimum 90% line coverage on all gameplay scripts (autoloads/, scripts/). Coverage enforced in CI — PRs that drop below threshold are blocked. (3) Static analysis via gdtoolkit (gdlint + gdformat) — zero warnings policy. (4) Headless scene smoke tests — every scene must load without errors in headless mode. (5) Playability integration tests — automated scenarios that simulate real gameplay headless and assert game state correctness. (6) Screenshot regression testing — capture UI screenshots in CI and compare against baselines. (7) Performance budgets — frame time benchmarks for key scenarios, CI fails if benchmarks regress beyond 15%. (8) Export validation — CI builds macOS and Windows exports and verifies they launch.\n\nConsequences: High confidence in every merge. Slower CI runs (~5-10 min) but catches regressions immediately. Test infrastructure built once, pays dividends on every subsequent epic. 90% coverage enforces testable architecture. Screenshot tests catch UI regressions that unit tests miss.","status":"open","priority":0,"issue_type":"decision","owner":"dave@mainstreetlogic.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T19:53:33Z","created_by":"Dave Tashner","updated_at":"2026-02-22T20:00:40Z","labels":["adr","architecture","ci"]}
